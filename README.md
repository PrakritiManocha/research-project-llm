Deep Researcher
A comprehensive research assistant that helps gather, analyze, and synthesize information from multiple sources to generate detailed research reports.

Features
Query Clarification: Interactive clarification of research queries to ensure precise understanding
Multi-Source Data Gathering: Collects information from:
arXiv research papers
Web articles (via DuckDuckGo, Google, and Tavily)
User-uploaded documents
Knowledge Base: Maintains a vectorized knowledge base for efficient information retrieval
Research Planning: Generates structured research outlines
Report Generation: Synthesizes comprehensive research reports with proper citations
Export Options: Exports reports in various formats (PDF, DOCX, etc.)
Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/deep-researcher.git
cd deep-researcher
Create a virtual environment (recommended):
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up environment variables: Create a .env file in the root directory with:
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key
GOOGLE_SEARCH_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
GOOGLE_CSE_ID=your_google_cse_id
Usage
Run the research pipeline:
python test_research_new.py
Enter your research query when prompted.

The system will:

Clarify your query through interactive conversation
Generate a research outline
Gather relevant information from multiple sources
Build a knowledge base
Generate a comprehensive report
Export the report in your preferred format
